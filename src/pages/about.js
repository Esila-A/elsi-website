            My name is Elsi Adajew. I am from Chechnya (from which my family
            fled during the war in 1999), but I've lived in Poland for 22 years
            now. I have spent most of my life here, so I feel as much a Pole as
            a Chechen.
            <br />
            <br />
            Due to my origin and experience, over the years I've collaborated with
            many organisations that work in the field of human rights and refugee aid.
            I regularly conduct workshops, give lectures and interviews, and participate in events
            sharing my experiences and knowledge in these fields. I am also
            the president of the "Sintar Foundation", an NGO that runs the
            "Sintar Center" - an innovative cultural and educational center,
            addressed mainly (but not exclusively) at Chechen children and
            youth. The main focus of Sintar are extracurricular activities that
            aim to prepare the young generation of refugees for a new life in
            Poland, and help them integrate with the Polish society.

            I've been interested in photography and film since I was a child,
            capturing the happy and peaceful moments and aspects of everyday life
            throughout the almost constant turmoil surrounding me back then.
            The hobby naturally evolved into my chosen profession, and I've been
            developing myself in this field with an even greater dedication since the recent years.
            I've started my own business - Elsi Adajew Connecting & Creating
            - and work as a photographer at both private
            and public events. I take photos of people, animals, products,
            landscapes. You can find examples of my works in the gallery and on
            my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mr.pandaev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text_instaLink">

            .
            <br />
            <br />I am very active on social media. I love being in touch with
            people, meeting new friends and expanding my experiences and
            knowledge. You can find me on Instagram, TikTok, FaceBook and
            Youtube. Feel free to get in touch either in here or one of these
            platforms.
