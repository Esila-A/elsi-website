            My name is Elsi Adajew. I am from Chechnya (from which my family
            fled during the war in 1999), but I've been living in Poland for
            22 years now. I have spent most of my life here, so I feel as much a
            Pole as a Chechen.
            <br />
            <br />
            Due to my origin and experience, for many years I've been
            cooperating with organizations working for refugees, migrants and
            human rights. I participate in events, conduct workshops, give
            lectures and interviews sharing my experiences and thoughts. I am
            also the president of the "Sintar Foundation", an NGO that runs the
            "Sintar Center" - an innovative cultural and educational center,
            addressed mainly (but not exclusively) to Chechen children and
            youth. The main activities of Sintar are extracurricular activities
            that prepare the young generation of refugees to live in Poland and
            respect the new homeland.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have been interested in photography and film since I was a child.
            In recent years I have taken it very seriously and have started to
            develop myself in this field. I started my own business - Elsi Adajew
            Connecting & Creating - and am employed as a photographer at both
            private and public events. I take photos of people, animals,
            products, landscapes. You can find examples of my works in the gallery
            and on my Instagram.
            <br />
            <br />I am very active on social media. I love being in touch
            with people, meeting new friends and expanding my experiences and
            knowledge. You can find me on Instagram, TikTok, FaceBook and Youtube.
            Feel free to get in touch either in here or one of these platforms.
